Writing Your First Application
==============================

.. note:: If you're not yet familiar with the fundamental architecture of a
          Fabric network, you may want to visit the :doc:`blockchain` and
          :doc:`build_network` documentation prior to continuing.

In this section we'll be looking at two sample applications to see how Fabric
apps work. These apps (and the smart contract they use) -- collectively known as
"Fabcar" -- involve querying a ledger that has been pre-populated with cars and
then updating that ledger to add new cars and to change car owners.

We’ll go through three principle steps:

  **1. Setting up a development environment.** Our application needs a network to
  interact with, so we'll download one stripped down to just the components we need
  to run queries and updates:

  .. image:: images/AppConceptsOverview.png

  **2. Learning the parameters of the sample smart contract our app will use.** Our
  smart contract contains various functions that allow us to interact with the ledger
  in different ways. We’ll go in and inspect that smart contract to learn about the
  functions our applications will be using.

  **3. Developing the applications to be able to query and update Fabric records.**
  We'll get into the app code itself (our apps have been written in Javascript) and
  manually manipulate the variables to run different kinds of queries and updates.

After completing this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of how
an application is programmed in conjunction with a smart contract to interact
with the ledger on a Fabric network. All in about 30 minutes.

First, let's get our network and our apps...

Setting up a Development Environment
------------------------------------

Visit the :doc:`prereqs` page and ensure you have the necessary dependencies
installed on your machine.

Also, let's remove any containers and chaincode (smart contracts run on
chaincode) images you might have running to ensure you don't have a port
conflict or Docker issue.

First, remove the containers:

.. code:: bash

  docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

Next, delete the chaincode image:

.. code:: bash

  docker rmi dev-peer0.org1.example.com-fabcar-1.0

Now that your machine is set up, navigate to a directory where you want the
samples downloaded to and issue the clone command:

.. code:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.git

This command will create a directory, ``fabric-samples`` (in which multiple
samples and tutorial apps have now been downloaded), and a specific
subdirectory, ``fabcar``.

Enter that directory:

.. code:: bash

  cd fabric-samples/fabcar

Now take a look at what's inside your ``fabcar`` directory.

.. code:: bash

  ls

You should see the following:

.. code:: bash

   chaincode	invoke.js	network		package.json	query.js	startFabric.sh

Use the ``startFabric.sh`` script to launch the network. This script downloads
and extracts the Fabric docker images, so it will take a few minutes to
complete:

.. code:: bash

  ./startFabric.sh

One last thing. We need to install the SDK (software development kit) node
modules:

.. code:: bash

  npm install

Alright, now that you’ve got a sample network and some code, let’s take a
look at how the different pieces fit together.

How Applications Interact with the Network
------------------------------------------

For a more in-depth look at the components in our Fabcar network (and how
they're deployed) as well as how applications interact with those components
on more of a granular level, click :doc:`understand_fabcar_network`.

Developers more interested in seeing what applications **do** -- as well as
looking at the code itself to see how an application is constructed -- should
continue. For now, the most important thing to know is that applications use
a software development kit (SDK) to access the **APIs** that permit queries and
updates to the ledger.

Querying the Ledger
-------------------

Queries are how you read data from the ledger. This data is stored as a series
of key/value pairs, and you can query for the value of a single key, multiple
keys, or -- if the ledger is written in a rich data storage format like JSON --
perform complex searches against it (looking for all assets that contain
certain keywords, for example).

This is a representation of how a query works:

.. image:: images/QueryingtheLedger.png

.. note:: You will issue all subsequent commands from the ``fabcar`` directory.

First, let's run our ``query.js`` program to return a listing of all the cars on
the ledger. A function that will query all the cars, ``queryAllCars``, is
pre-loaded in the app, so we can simply run the program as is:

.. code:: bash

  node query.js

It should return something like this:

.. code:: json

  Query result count =  1
  Response is  [{"Key":"CAR0", "Record":{"colour":"blue","make":"Toyota","model":"Prius","owner":"Tomoko"}},
  {"Key":"CAR1",   "Record":{"colour":"red","make":"Ford","model":"Mustang","owner":"Brad"}},
  {"Key":"CAR2", "Record":{"colour":"green","make":"Hyundai","model":"Tucson","owner":"Jin Soo"}},
  {"Key":"CAR3", "Record":{"colour":"yellow","make":"Volkswagen","model":"Passat","owner":"Max"}},
  {"Key":"CAR4", "Record":{"colour":"black","make":"Tesla","model":"S","owner":"Adriana"}},
  {"Key":"CAR5", "Record":{"colour":"purple","make":"Peugeot","model":"205","owner":"Michel"}},
  {"Key":"CAR6", "Record":{"colour":"white","make":"Chery","model":"S22L","owner":"Aarav"}},
  {"Key":"CAR7", "Record":{"colour":"violet","make":"Fiat","model":"Punto","owner":"Pari"}},
  {"Key":"CAR8", "Record":{"colour":"indigo","make":"Tata","model":"Nano","owner":"Valeria"}},
  {"Key":"CAR9", "Record":{"colour":"brown","make":"Holden","model":"Barina","owner":"Shotaro"}}]

These are the 10 cars. A black Tesla Model S owned by Adriana, a red Ford Mustang
owned by Brad, a violet Fiat Punto owned by Pari, and so on. The ledger is
key/value based and in our implementation the key is ``CAR0`` through ``CAR9``.
This will become particularly important in a moment.

Now let's see what it looks like under the hood (if you'll forgive the pun).
Use an editor (e.g. atom or visual studio) and open the ``query.js`` program.

The initial section of the application defines certain variables such as
chaincode ID, channel name and network endpoints. In our sample app, these
variables have been baked-in, but in a real app these variables would have to
be specified by the app dev.

.. code:: bash

  var options = {
      wallet_path: path.join(__dirname, './network/creds'),
      user_id: 'PeerAdmin',
      channel_id: 'mychannel',
      chaincode_id: 'fabcar',
      network_url: 'grpc://localhost:7051',
  };

This is the chunk where we construct our query:

.. code:: bash

     // queryCar - requires 1 argument, ex: args: ['CAR4'],
     // queryAllCars - requires no arguments , ex: args: [''],
     const request = {
           chaincodeId: options.chaincode_id,
           txId: transaction_id,
           fcn: 'queryAllCars',
           args: ['']
     };

When the application ran, it invoked the fabcar smart contract, ran the
``queryAllCars`` function within it, and passed no arguments to it.

To take a look at the available functions within our smart contract, navigate
to the ``chaincode`` subdirectory and open ``fabcar.go`` in your editor. You'll
see that we have the following functions available to call: ``initLedger``,
``queryCar``, ``queryAllCars``, ``createCar``, and ``changeCarOwner``.

Let's take a closer look at the ``queryAllCars`` function to see how it
interacts with the ledger.

.. code:: bash

   func (s *SmartContract) queryAllCars(APIstub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) sc.Response {

	startKey := "CAR0"
	endKey := "CAR999"

	resultsIterator, err := APIstub.GetStateByRange(startKey, endKey)

This defines the range of ``queryAllCars``. Every car between ``CAR0`` and
``CAR999`` -- 1,000 cars in all, assuming every call has been tagged properly
-- will be returned by the query.

Below is a representation of how an app would call different functions in
chaincode, showing the various APIs -- ``createCar``, ``queryallCars``, etc --
available to use.

.. image:: images/RunningtheSample.png

We can see our ``queryAllCars`` function, as well as one called ``createCar``,
that will allow us to update the ledger and ultimately append a new block to
the chain in a moment.

But first, go back to the ``query.js`` program and edit the constructor request
to query ``CAR4``. We do this by changing the function in ``query.js`` from
``queryAllCars`` to ``queryCar`` and passing ``CAR4`` as the specific
“argument” (or “key”).

``query.js`` should now look like this:

.. code:: bash

  const request = {
        chaincodeId: options.chaincode_id,
        txId: transaction_id,
        fcn: 'queryCar',
        args: ['CAR4']
  };

Save the program and navigate back to your ``fabcar`` directory.  Now run the
program again:

.. code:: bash

  node query.js

You should see the following:

.. code:: json

  {"colour":"black","make":"Tesla","model":"S","owner":"Adriana"}

If you go back and look at the result from when we queried every car before,
you can see that CAR4 was Adriana’s black Tesla model S, which is the result
that was returned here.

Using the ``queryCar`` function, we can query against any key (e.g. ``CAR0``)
and get whatever make, model, color, and owner correspond to that car.

Great. At this point you should be comfortable with the basic query functions
in the smart contract and the handful of parameters in the query program.
Time to update the ledger...

Updating the Ledger
-------------------

Now that we’ve done a few ledger queries and added a bit of code, we’re ready to
update the ledger. There are a lot of potential updates we could make, but
let's start by creating a car.

Below we can see how this process works. An update is proposed, endorsed,
then returned to the application, which sends it to be ordered and written
to the ledger:

.. image:: images/UpdatingtheLedger.png

Our first update to the ledger will be to create a new car.  We have a separate
Javascript program -- ``invoke.js`` -- that we will use to make updates. Just
as with queries, use an editor to open the program and navigate to the
codeblock where we construct our invocation:

.. code:: bash

    // createCar - requires 5 args, ex: args: ['CAR11', 'Honda', 'Accord', 'Black', 'Tom'],
    // changeCarOwner - requires 2 args , ex: args: ['CAR10', 'Barry'],
    // send proposal to endorser
    var request = {
        targets: targets,
        chaincodeId: options.chaincode_id,
        fcn: '',
        args: [''],
        chainId: options.channel_id,
        txId: tx_id
    };

You'll see that we can call one of two functions - ``createCar`` or
``changeCarOwner``. First, let’s create a red Chevy Volt and give it to an
owner named Nick. We're up to ``CAR9`` on our ledger, so we'll use ``CAR10``
as the identifying key here. Edit this codeblock to look like this:

.. code:: bash

    var request = {
        targets: targets,
        chaincodeId: options.chaincode_id,
        fcn: 'createCar',
        args: ['CAR10', 'Chevy', 'Volt', 'Red', 'Nick'],
        chainId: options.channel_id,
        txId: tx_id
    };

Save it and run the program:

.. code:: bash

   node invoke.js

There will be some output in the terminal about Proposal Response and
Transaction ID. However, all we're concerned with is this message:

.. code:: bash

   The transaction has been committed on peer localhost:7053

To see that this transaction has been written, go back to ``query.js`` and
change the argument from ``CAR4`` to ``CAR10``.

In other words, change this:

  const request = {
        chaincodeId: options.chaincode_id,
        txId: transaction_id,
        fcn: 'queryCar',
        args: ['CAR4']
  };

To this:

.. code:: bash

  const request = {
        chaincodeId: options.chaincode_id,
        txId: transaction_id,
        fcn: 'queryCar',
        args: ['CAR10']
  };

Save once again, then query:

.. code:: bash

  node query.js

Which should return this:

.. code:: bash

   Response is  {"colour":"Red","make":"Chevy","model":"Volt","owner":"Nick"}

Congratulations. You’ve created a car!

So now that we’ve done that, let’s say that Nick is feeling generous and he
wants to give his Chevy Volt to someone named Barry.

To do this go back to ``invoke.js`` and change the function from ``createCar``
to ``changeCarOwner`` and input the arguments like this:

.. code:: bash

     var request = {
         targets: targets,
         chaincodeId: options.chaincode_id,
         fcn: 'changeCarOwner',
         args: ['CAR10', 'Barry'],
         chainId: options.channel_id,
         txId: tx_id
     };

The first argument -- ``CAR10`` -- reflects the car that will be changing
owners. The second argument -- ``Barry`` -- defines the new owner of the car.

Save and execute the program again:

.. code:: bash

  node invoke.js

Now let’s query the ledger and see that it’s been updated to reflect this:

.. code:: bash

  node query.js

It should return this result:

.. code:: bash

   Response is  {"colour":"Red","make":"Chevy","model":"Volt","owner":"Barry"}

The ownership of ``CAR10`` has been changed from Nick to Barry.

Summary
-------

Now that we’ve done a few queries and a few updates, you should have a pretty
good sense of how applications interact with the network. You’ve seen the basics
of the roles smart contracts, APIs, and the SDK play in queries and updates and
you should have a feel for how different kinds of applications could be used to
perform other business tasks and operations.

In subsequent documents we’ll learn how to actually **write** a smart contract
and how some of these more low level application functions can be leveraged
(especially relating to identity and membership services).
